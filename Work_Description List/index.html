                    <h2>Component Based Architecture</h2>
                    <p>React.js follows a component-based architecture, which allows developers to break down the UI into reusable, self-contained components. This modular approach promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability, making it easier to build and maintain large-scale applications.</p>

                    <h2>Virtual DOM</h2>
                    <p>React.js utilizes a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) that efficiently updates and renders only the components that have changed, rather than re-rendering the entire page. This optimization technique results in faster rendering and improved performance, providing a smoother user experience.</p>

                    <h2>Unidirectional Data Flow</h2>
                    <p>React.js promotes a unidirectional data flow, where data flows in a single direction, from parent components to child components. This makes it easier to understand how data changes propagate through the application, reducing bugs and making debugging more manageable.</p>

                <li>
                    <h2>React Native for Mobile Development</h2>
                    <p>React Native, built upon React.js, enables developers to build cross-platform mobile applications using the same JavaScript codebase. This code-sharing capability significantly reduces development time and effort, making React Native a preferred choice for mobile app development.</p>
